# Introduction

## PDF - Probability Density Function
Measures the possiblity for a variable to take a certain value
- results are $ { \in [0,1]} $
$$ {f(x) = P(X=x)} $$

- ${X}$ - variable
- ${x}$ - one of the values that ${X}$ may take

## CDF - Cumulative Distribution Function
Measures the possibility for continuous random variable ${X}$ to take values within a certain interval
$$ { F(x) = P(X \le x ) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t) \ dt} $$

- If ${X}$ is a purely discrete random variable, then it attains values ${x_1, x_2, ...}$ with probability ${p_i = P(x_i)}$

- **discrete random variable** = quantity whose value is determined by chance; it can only take a countable or finite number of values
